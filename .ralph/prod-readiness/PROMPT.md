# Agent Prompt

## Critical Paths

**Base Path**: `.ralph/prod-readiness/`

| File       | Relative Path |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| PLAN.md    | `PLAN.md`     |
| Specs      | `specs/`      |
| ADRs       | `adrs/`       |
| Scratchpad | `scratchpad/` |
| Archive    | `archive/`    |

### Signal Files

Create these files in the Base Path to signal terminal states:

| File            | When to Create                                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ralph.done`    | All PLAN.md items are complete - no more work to do                              |
| `ralph.blocked` | Agent is blocked awaiting human decision (ADR review, escalation after 3+ turns) |

> **Note:** These files signal to external systems that the agent has stopped. Do not commit them.

### Path Resolution Rules

1. **First action of every turn**: Run `pwd` to confirm working directory
2. **Always use forward slashes** (`/`) in all paths - they work on all platforms including Windows
3. **Construct absolute paths** by joining CWD + relative path from the table above
4. **Never search for these files** - their locations are fixed; do not use glob/find to locate them

## Definitions

**Turn**: The complete cycle of selecting and working on ONE item from PLAN.md until the **main agent** decides to:
- ✅ Complete (tests pass, committed, pushed)
- ❌ Fail (document blocker, stop)
- ⏸️ Escalate (3+ attempts without resolution, or blocked awaiting human decision)

**Main Agent**: The orchestrator. Owns the turn. Delegates to subagents. Only the main agent decides when a turn ends.

**Turn Scope Constraints**:
- ONE item per turn (e.g., "Task 4.3 - Add unit tests")
- NEVER start work on the next item if the current item completes early
- If you finish early, update PLAN.md, commit, push, and **end the turn**
- Phase boundaries are hard stops—completing Phase 4 does NOT mean starting Phase 5

**Subagents**: Workers spawned by the main agent to execute specific tasks (study specs, discover implementation, file edits, searches, builds). Subagents do NOT control turn boundaries—they report results back to the main agent.

---

## Workflow

### Prerequisites
0. Study these files with subagents before starting (see **Critical Paths** for exact locations):
   - `specs/`
   - `PLAN.md`

### Execution Steps

1. **Select ONE Item**: Pick the SINGLE highest-priority incomplete item from PLAN.md. Work ONLY on this item until completion, failure, or escalation. **Never work on multiple items or cross phase boundaries in a single turn.** If no actionable items remain, create `ralph.done` in the Base Path, summarise status, and stop.

   **Before writing any code, verify:**
   - [ ] I have selected exactly ONE item
   - [ ] This item is in the same phase as any previous work this turn
   - [ ] I will stop after this item completes, even if time remains

   > **Parallelism scope**: Subagents may parallelise work *within* the selected item (e.g., editing disjoint files for the same task). Parallelism does NOT mean selecting multiple items. Never assign two subagents to edit the same file.

2. **Test Strategically**: After implementing functionality or resolving problems, run tests for the affected code. If functionality is missing, add it as per the specifications.

3. **Track Issues**: When you discover an issue, immediately update PLAN.md with your findings using a subagent. When the issue is resolved, update PLAN.md and remove the item using a subagent.

4. **Commit & Push**: When all tests pass, use subagents to update PLAN.md with your progress and commit all changes with `git add -A && git commit` with a message that describes the changes. **Always co-author commits as "Ralph Agent <no-reply@ralph.local>"** using the `--trailer` flag. After the commit, do a `git push` to push changes to the remote repository.

   **Before committing, verify:**
   - [ ] All affected tests have been **executed** (not just compiled) — see CLAUDE.md "Verification Strategy" for tier definitions
   - [ ] Pre-commit verification passes: `dotnet test --filter "Category!=Property"` on affected projects, plus integration tests if integration code changed
   - [ ] If a test category cannot run locally, document WHY and mark the item as incomplete — do NOT commit with "deferred to CI"

5. **Failure Protocol**: When tests fail repeatedly, summarise and record the issue in PLAN.md. Mark it as the single most important thing to resolve in the next turn, then stop this turn.

6. **Debug Logging**: You may add temporary logging to assist debugging (see CLAUDE.md for log file locations and interpretation). Remove debug logging before final commit unless operationally valuable.

7. **Keep PLAN.md Current**: ALWAYS keep PLAN.md up to date with your learnings using a subagent. Especially after wrapping up/finishing your turn.

8. **Update CLAUDE.md**: When you learn something new about how to run the app or send a request to a handler, update CLAUDE.md using a subagent (keep it brief). For example, if you run commands multiple times before learning the correct command, that file should be updated.

9. **Bug Discovery**: When you discover a bug, document it in PLAN.md. If related to the current work, resolve it using subagents. If unrelated, record it in PLAN.md as the next priority for the following turn.

10. **PLAN.md Size Management**: When PLAN.md grows above 300 lines, clean out completed items using a subagent.

11. **Specs Authority**: If there is a discrepancy between PLAN.md and the specs, always update PLAN.md to match the specs.

12. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Create an ADR when you encounter a blocker requiring deviation from established patterns (new dependencies, data flow changes, infrastructure components).

    > **ADRs are escalation gates:**
    > 1. Document the decision needed in `adrs/`
    > 2. Mark related PLAN.md items as **BLOCKED - awaiting ADR review**
    > 3. Commit and push all changes (including the ADR)
    > 4. Create `ralph.blocked` in the Base Path
    > 5. End the turn - do NOT continue with other work
    > 6. A human will review and communicate their decision

13. **CLAUDE.md Protection**: DO NOT place status report updates into CLAUDE.md.

14. **Escalation**: If an item has been worked on for 3+ consecutive turns without completion, summarise and escalate by documenting blockers in PLAN.md, create `ralph.blocked` in the Base Path, and finish your turn.

15. **Scratchpad**: Use `scratchpad/` directory for temporary files during your turn.

    > **Scratchpad rules:**
    > - Scratchpad files **may survive across turns** — you do not need to clean them up before ending your turn
    > - When updating PLAN.md at the end of your turn, **reference any useful scratchpad files** so the next turn knows they exist and can use them
    > - **NEVER commit or push scratchpad files** — ensure they are excluded from `git add`

---

## PLAN.md Update Rules

> **IMPORTANT:** Follow these rules when updating PLAN.md to prevent incorrect status tracking.

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Line Count Check (DO THIS FIRST)

**Before making ANY updates to the plan:**
1. Check line count: `wc -l PLAN.md`
2. If **above 300 lines**: STOP and archive completed phases before proceeding
   - Move completed phase details to `archive/completed_phases.md`
   - Keep only phase title + "✅ COMPLETE" summary in this file
   - Then continue with your update

**Current line count must stay under 300 lines.**
